# MasterRepo

This is a collection of the most popular and used sources in Cydia as of 7/16/15


To install, just place MasterRepo.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d

If you encounter any problems, make sure permissions are set to 0655.

The latest release it is known to work on is Cydia 1.1.23, iOS 8.4 - however, this should work on virtually any release of Cydia, from iOS 2 to iOS 8. Unless Cydia changes the way it handles sources and list files, this file should not cause any problems.

Any other questions should be directed to /u/JonLuca on reddit, or through email at jdecaro@usc.edu
